<p>The CATBox app is a companion to the textbook <a
href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9783540148876">CATBox &#151;
An Interactive Course in Combinatorial Optimization</a> by Winfried
Hochst&auml;ttler and Alexander Schliep published by Springer in
2010.</p>

<p>The animations of the algorithms implemented for the textbook are
created with the open-source desktop software <a
href="http://gato.sf.net">Gato</a> by the same authors, which is also
available as source and binaries from the website <a
href="http://schliep.org/CATBox">http://schliep.org/CATBox</a>.</p>


<p>With Gato you can edit the graph instances the algorithms
operate on and implement and animate your own algorithms. The
animations can also be exported to HTML.</p>


<h3>History</h3>

<p>The graph animation toolbox (Gato) started its life 1997 at the
Universit&auml;t zu K&ouml;ln as a cross-platform desktop application
written in Python using Tkinter for its graphical user
interface. Algorithms are also implemented in Python and
semi-automatically animated. Development of Gato continued from 2002
until 2009 at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in
Berlin and, since 2009, at Rutgers, The State University of New
Jersey.</p>

<p>A frequent feature request was backward execution, or to be able
to jump back in the execution time-line. The solution was to record
animation histories in Gato, combined with light-weight players for
the animation histories. Additionally, this technical solution made both
WebGato and the CATBox app feasible.</p>


<h3>Developers of Web Gato</h3>

<p>Scott Merkling is the main developer of the Gato app and WebGato
online system; he was also the maintainer of Gato since 2012 and
implemented the support of animation histories in Gato. Matt Mitsui
implemented an earlier proof of concept of the WebGato online
system. Alexander Schliep is the original author of Gato and has been
directing the development of Gato, WebGato and the CATBox app ever since.
