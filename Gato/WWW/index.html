<p>Gato - the Graph Animation Toolbox - is a software which visualizes
algorithms on graphs. Graphs are mathematical objects consisting of
vertices and edges connecting pairs of vertices: think of cities as
vertices and interstates as edges connecting two cities. Algorithms
might find a shortest path - the fastest route - or a minimal
spanning tree or solve one of other interesting problems on graphs:
maximal-flow, weighted and non-weighted matching and min-cost
flow. Visualisation means linking cause - the statements of an
algorithm - immediately to an effect - changes to the graph the
algorithm has as its input - by terms of blinking, changing colors and
other visual effects.</p>

<a href="http://www.zaik.de/AFS">ZAIK/ZPR</a>, an institute at the
<a href="http://www.uni-koeln.de">Unversität zu Köln</a>. Gato is freely
available under the LGPL and runs on all plattforms Python and Tcl/Tk
run on, which includes at least Unix, Linux, MacOS X and Windows 98,
NT, XP.</p>

<p>Gato is used in CATBox (the Combinatorial Algorithm Toolbox - an
interactive course on discrete mathematics) to be published by
Springer Verlag and has been used for courses on algorithms - both in
the Computer Science and the Mathematics department - taught at the
University of Cologne, the Technical University Cottbus and Free
University Berlin.</p>
