<p>Gato - the Graph Animation Toolbox - is a software which visualizes
algorithms on graphs. Graphs are mathematical objects consisting of
vertices and edges connecting pairs of vertices: think of cities as
vertices and interstates as edges connecting two cities. Algorithms
might find a shortest path - the fastest route - or a minimal
spanning tree or solve one of other interesting problems on graphs:
maximal-flow, weighted and non-weighted matching and min-cost
flow. Visualisation means linking cause - the statements of an
algorithm - immediately to an effect - changes to the graph the
algorithm has as its input - by terms of blinking, changing colors and
other visual effects.</p>

<p>WebGato is a standards-compliant JavaScript-player which allows to
  play animation created with Gato on the web. Examples can be seen

Mathematics department taught at the University of Cologne, the
Technical University Cottbus and Free University Berlin. You find
