<H1>Gato: Installation</H1>


<h3>Requirements</H3>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> version 2.7.X. Gato is still not
yet quite compatible with Python 3.X.
<li> <a href="http://www.tcl.tk">Tk</A> version 8.4.7 or above
<li> Tkinter module enabled in Python
</ul>

<h3>Unix (Linux, MacOS X, BSD, ...)</h3>

<p>Most distributions come with Python installed. You can check that you are all set up
by invoking the Python interpreter in a terminal
<pre>
  > python
  Python 2.6.4 (r264:75706, Mar 16 2010, 09:46:46) 
  [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5490)] on darwin
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> import Tkinter
  >>> t = Tkinter.Tk()
  >>> 
</pre>
Ctrl-D exists the Python shell. If there are problems, or you only
have an outdated Python version available install Python and Tkinter
packages with the package manager for your distribution.</p>

<p>If your Python is set-up, download Gato, unpack it and execute
either Gato.py or Gred.py by evoking
<pre>
  you@yourbox> python Gato.py
</pre>
You can also manually create symlinks as follows. Make Gato and Gred
executable for everybopd by changing the protections. Make sure that
the directory where they reside has the right execute and read
permissions and that the read permissions for all files in the
directory are correct (A umask 022 before unpacking helps)
<pre>
  > chmod 755 Gato.py Gred.py
</pre>
Create symbolic links to the executables in a directory contained in
your path with
<pre>
  > cd dir_on_path
  > ln -s /whereever_you_put_gato/Gato.py gato 
  > ln -s /whereever_you_put_gato/Gred.py gred
</pre>
so all users on the system can use gato and gred without worrying
about paths or gato's files cluttered in all kinds of directories.
</p>

<p>If you want to install Gato permanently, you can do so by using 
Python's setuptools and the provided <tt>setup.py</tt> in the Gato
directory,
<pre>
> python setup.py install
</pre>
to install Gato in the default <tt>site-packages</tt> directory
for your python installation. If you need to install it elsewhere
you can control the install location by specifying an alternative
prefix path and/or an alternative Python interpreter.
<pre>
> /some/otherpath/python setup.py install --prefix=/yetanotherpath/
</pre></P>

<p>WebGato: So that HTML files containing animations can find all the
  JavaScript and CSS code symbolic links to directories <tt>Gato/svgs/js</tt>
  and <tt>Gato/svgs/css</tt> from the Gato distribution are needed. If you install Gato
  with <tt>setup.py</tt> you can use the provided script <tt>gato-create-js-css-symlinks</tt>.
	  Otherwise, locate the directories and issue the commands
	  <pre>
		> ln -s /.../Gato/svgs/css .
		> ln -s	/.../Gato/svgs/js .
</pre>
<p>

<H3>Linux packages</H3>

For Gentoo there is a Gato package available at <A
HREF="http://packages.gentoo.org/search/?sstring=Graph%20Animation%20Toolbox">http://packages.gentoo.org/search/?sstring=Graph%20Animation%20Toolbox</A>.


<H3>BSD</H3>

There is a port of Gato available under the name <em>py-gato</em>, see
<A
HREF="http://portsmon.freebsd.org/portoverview.py?category=math&portname=py-gato">http://portsmon.freebsd.org/portoverview.py?category=math&portname=py-gato</A>



<H3>MacOS X</H3>

<p>Python with Tcl/Tk on MaxOS X 10.15 seems to run quite stably. As
  there are increasingly severe requirements for code signing and
  security (clearly, generally a good thing, just a bit cumbersome if
  you are not a fulltime dev), downloaded binaries will likely not
  work without jumping through some hoops.</P>

<P>MacOS X Version 10.4 and above come with and Tkinter installed.
You can run Gato either using with or without X11, based on the Tk
library (Tk for X11, or AquaTk) used. If you want to use Gato without
X11 you need to start it with <tt>pythonw</tt>, otherwise you will
just get an error message. From within X11 you need to
use <tt>python</tt>. Updates to the Python which comes pre-installed
on MacOS X are available
  from <A href="http://www.python.org/download">http://www.python.org/download</A>.
  I advise updating to the latest Python 2.7.x version.
</p>

<p>We also make a download available of Gato.app which runs directly
on MacOS X 10.4 and above. Check the <a href="Download/">Download</A>
page. You find also more recent binary releases at <A
HREF="http://schliep.org/CATBox/">http://schliep.org/CATBox/</A> as
part of the CATBox distribution. Bear in mind possible code signing issues.</P>

<p>If you want to use X11 on MacOS X you can check whether you are all
set up using example under the Linux instructions.</P>


<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>On <a
href="http://www.python.org/download/">http://www.python.org/download/</A>
you can find a one (well, multiple) click installer which installs
everything you need. After you have downloaded Gato and unpacked
everything double-clicking Gato.py should start the software. You find
a binary release at <A
HREF="http://schliep.org/CATBox/">http://schliep.org/CATBox/</A> as
part of the CATBox distribution.</p>
